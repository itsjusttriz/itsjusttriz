This directory contains "super-optimised" config files for your minecraft client.

These options are configured to my personal taste while being stuck with an Intel Celeron and Integrated Graphics.

# Key
- `options.txt` - Vanilla visual/audio/keybind settings (version dependant)
- `optionsof.txt` - Optifine settings (version dependant)
